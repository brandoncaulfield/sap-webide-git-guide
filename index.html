		<h1>Important Concepts in SAP WebIDE</h1>
		<p>	
			SAP WebIDE allows you to create a git repository for each project you work on and the creation of the repository is controlled from within the SAP WebIDE itself. If you want to work 
			on an application (that you did not create yourself) from the WebIDE then you will need to clone the repository as you would any other normal git repository. Once you have made your changes you have to first <code>pull</code> the latest version from the remote repository into your local origin/master, merge your changes, fix any issues and then only push your changes to the remote repository if you want other developers to see your changes.
		</p><br />
		<h2>Important git commands</h2>
		<p>
			<code>pull</code><br />
			Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>fetch</code><br />
			Fetching refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches (the code residing on your local machine).
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>push</code><br />
			Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			When in the SAP WebIDE you'll find most of what you need in the Git Menu near the top right of the screen. You'll also find the console towards the bottom right of the screen which can be very useful when trying to see what happened as you interact with the git repository.
		</p> 
		<img src="img/concepts_001.png" alt="concepts_001">
		<p>
			A great way to see if you've successfully pushed your changes to the remote repository is to  download the Git desktop client and clone the repositroy from there. Once you have the files on your desktop you can open them in your favourite IDE and see if your changes are there. 
		</p>
		<img src="img/concepts_002.png" alt="concepts_002">
		<p>
			When creating a new UI5 app the web IDE will create a remote repository for you. This URL is what will be used when you <code>set remote</code> your newly created repository with the remote repository on GitHubs servers.
		</p>
		<img src="img/concepts_003.png" alt="concepts_003">
		<p>
			In the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit you'll find the remote Git repository link under the versioning section after you've clicked on the HTML5 app itself.

		<h2>Using Branches</h2>
		<h3>Scenario:</h3>
		<p>You have a master remote branch that is stored on github.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Main Developer: has a local copy of the remote master (local master) that they put there originally using <code>set remote</code>.</li>
			<li>2nd Developer has a local copy of the remote master (local master)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Each developer can now leave the master branch as is which means that there are effectively 3 versions of the master branch:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>GitHub:</b></li> 
			<li>origin/master (remote on GitHub servers)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Main Developer</b></li> 
				<li>origin/master (local)</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>2nd Developer:</b></li> 
					<li>origin/master (local)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				All three versions contain the same code for now. Then each developer decides to make their own changes and so they both create their own unique local branch of the local origin/master version they have on their local machines.The main developer creates a local branch called changeABC_branch and the 2nd developer creates a local branch called changeXYZ_branch. In our scenario we now have the following branches:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>GitHub:</b></li>
					<li>origin/master (remote on GitHub servers)</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Main Developer:</b></li> 
					<li>origin/master (local)</li>
					<li>changeABC_branch (local)</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><b>2nd Developer:</b></li>
					<li>origin/master (local)</li>
					<li>changeXYZ_branch(local)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The idea with each developer creating a branch for each change is that they can make the change in this branch and then before committing to the remote repository they can pull any changes made by other developers to their local origin/master branch. Then they can try to merge the changes from, for example changeXYZ_branch, locally and test if their changes will work with the other developers recent changes. This helps in scenarios where the main developer has made changes yesterday and you want to merger your changes with his. In this scenario, after you've finished working on your custom branch, you simply change back from the changeXYZ_branch to the origin/master branch.

				<img src="img/branch_001.png" alt="branch_001">
				<img src="img/branch_002.png" alt="branch_002">
				<p>
					<code>pull</code> / <code>fetch</code><br /> the changes from the remote origin/master branch to make sure you have the most up to date changes from the remote repository on GitHub.
				</p>
				<img src="img/branch_003.png" alt="branch_003">
				<p>
					<code>merge</code><br /> your origin/master branch with the remote origin/master by clicking on the merge button.
				</p>
				<img src="img/branch_004.png" alt="branch_004">
				<p>
					After the merge has completed you can go and check the source code files to see if the code has been updated with changes you donâ€™t recognise (which are most likely changes made and pushed to the remote repository by the another developer).
